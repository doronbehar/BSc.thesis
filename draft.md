# Abstract
The weak force in the standard model is considered to be responsible for energy shifts in energy levels and can be isolated when comparing the spectrum of left and right handed chiral molecules. Our groupâ€™s goal is to measure this shift, which has never been measured directly with spectroscopic methods.
Standard model numerical calculations predict this weak force shift, also referred to as parity violation (PV) shift to be $\Delta PV = 1.8Hz$ at best, in the C-H wag vibration of CHDBrI+ <!--TODO: Cite-->, while the vibration itself is at the (IR) frequency of $\nu_v = 33 (\sim 9 \mu m)$!
Our $\Delta PV$ measurement plan, broadly speaking consists of (1) initializing our candidate molecule (CHDBrI), (2) ionizing it, (3) sympathetically cool it with an easily LASER cooled metal (Yb+ in our current attempts), (4) employ a 3 wave mixing technique to create an enantiomer-selective quantum interference, which separates enantiomers into different quantum state.
<!--TODO: Cite Itay's thesis, or our group's articles, an article about sympathetic cooling-->
