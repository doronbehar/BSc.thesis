# Introduction
The weak force in the standard model is considered to be responsible for energy shifts in energy levels and can be isolated when comparing the spectrum of left and right handed chiral molecules. Our groupâ€™s goal is to measure this shift, which has never been measured directly with spectroscopic methods.
Standard model numerical calculations predict this weak force shift to be $\Delta PV = 1.8Hz$ at best, in the C-H wag vibration of CHDBrI+[1, 4], while the vibration itself is at the (IR) frequency of $\nu_v = 33THz (\sim 9\mum)$!
