# Abstract
The weak force in the standard model is considered to be responsible for energy shifts in energy levels and can be isolated when comparing the spectrum of left and right handed chiral molecules. Our groupâ€™s goal is to measure this shift, which has never been measured directly with spectroscopic methods.
Standard model numerical calculations predict this weak force shift, also referred to as parity violation (PV) shift to be $\Delta_{PV} = 1.8Hz$ at best, in the C-H wag vibration of CHDBrI+ <!--TODO: Cite-->, while the vibration itself is at the (IR) frequency of $\nu_v = 33 (\sim 9 \mu m)$!
The C-H wag vibrational frequency of our candidate enantiomers, as well as for other molecules we considered, is roughly $23\pm 4 \,\mathrm{cm^{-1}}$ times higher then the lowest frequency vibration, with 7 additional vibrational frequencies in between. This implies that the lifetime of the excited C-H wag vibrating state of any of our most promising candidate molecules will be limited by intra-molecular vibration redistribution (IVR). An estimate of the extent of this limitation was calculated numerically and it's results are described in detail in this thesis. In <!--TODO: cite--> you can find a brief summary of the results.
Our $\Delta_{PV}$ measurement plan, broadly speaking consists of (1) initializing our candidate molecule (CHDBrI), (2) ionizing it, (3) sympathetically cool it with an easily LASER cooled metal (Yb+ in our current attempts), (4) employ a 3 wave mixing technique to create an enantiomer-selective quantum interference, which separates enantiomers into different quantum state. <!--TODO: Cite Itay's thesis, or our group's articles, an article about sympathetic cooling-->
Sympathetically cooling a molecule is well known already achieved accomplishment, <!--TODO: Cite a few examples -->. however, _our_ measurement plan is substantially different from the experimental schemes employed in other experiments in which molecules are sympathetically cooled, because the molecule initialization is not trivial. This led us to design the experiment such that the molecule is trapped for periods $<1s$,
